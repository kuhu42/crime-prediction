## Crime Prediction
This project leverages machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest for crime prediction and K-Means for resource allocation, the system analyses historical data.
Preprocessing techniques and feature engineering ensure data quality, while interactive visualizations (Matplotlib and Seaborn) aid in understanding trends. The outcome is an efficient, scalable system providing law enforcement with actionable insights for evidence-based decision-making.
It utilises readily available data in form of .csv files, this system promotes error-free, reliable, and efficient crime analysis. This project emphasises societal well-being by empowering law enforcement with predictive insights and optimizes resource allocation for more effective crime prevention.

The anticipated outcome is a versatile and scalable system that empowerslaw enforcement agencies with valuable insights derived from historical crime data. This platform not only streamlines the crime reporting process but also contributes to more efficient resource allocation and proactive crime prevention strategies. The emphasis on data analysis and visualization tools aims to foster evidence-based decision-making for a safer community.
The final aim for this porject is to be developed into a user-friendly online crime reporting and predicting platform.
